# Organization
Experimental usage of GitHub as primary tool for managing and reviewing internal organizational structure, making use of its many features for online contribution.

**This is a fully public repository, meaning that any contributions will be visible to anyone on the internet, somewhat forever.**


## Example workflow
_This section briefly outlines how an example workflow could go_

##### Spotting an issue
When you spot an issue you can report it as an issue, so that others can see it and comment on it. Eventually someone can pick it up and fix it!

###### Create an issue

<!-- https://github.com/AEGEE/organization/.... -->

###### Comment and assign

##### Adding content
On the main 'code' page you can easily add content by pressing the `add new file` button and edit it online, after which it is immediately added to the project! This way you can pick up issues, and resolve them.

###### Created a new file
